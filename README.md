## Data

The data was taken from [CINC 2011](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2011/1.0.0/#files-panel)
and [CINC 2017](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2017/1.0.0/) datasets.

Some processing decisions:

> The data is cut to 10 second samples in order to start organizing it. 
> some was lost, so I will come back to that at a later point.
> 
> Then it is downsampled to 100Hz In order to have similar length signals
